We know the negative images of Africa -- famine and disease, conflict and corruption. But, says Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, there's another, less-told story happening in many African nations: one of reform, economic growth and business opportunity.

At TED@MotorCity, Lisa Gansky, author of "The Mesh," talks about a future of business that's about sharing all kinds of stuff, either via smart and tech-enabled rental or, more boldly, peer-to-peer. Examples across industries -- from music to cars -- show how close we are to this meshy future.

 Lisa Gansky is the author of "The Mesh: Why the Future of Business Is Sharing," and the instigator behind the Mesh Directory (www.meshing.it).

The digital revolution has changed much more than technology, entertainment and design. It has completely transformed business -- in ways that could scarcely have been imaginable at TED's first conference, in 1984.
 
Chris Anderson of WIRED explores the four key stages of viable technology: setting the right price, gaining market share, displacing established technology and, finally, becoming ubiquitous. Marketing guru Seth Godin spells out why, when it comes to getting attention onto a product, bizarre ideas are more successful than boring ones. And Malcolm Gladwell comes to a fascinating, counterintuitive truth about product development through the tale of one man's quest to find the perfect pasta sauce.

Sergey Brin and Larry Page offer a peek inside the Google machine, sharing tidbits about international search patterns and the philanthropic Google Foundation project (which soon became Google.org). Jeff Skoll, founder of eBay, social entrepreneur and film financier, speaks out for media that educates, changes minds and impels us to action. And iconic businessman Richard Branson reveals some of the (surprising) motivations with which he bootstrapped his way from record shop owner to head of the Virgin empire.
 
Sounds like a great idea. People are already investing in companies with a cause they believe in. This could make the idea more visible and easy.
 We only have 1 TV and 1 public radio station in a major city, which is highly dependent on the government. They are too bland, so who wants to fund them?
 How come we can't have free media like TV or radio? Instead the "public" airways are auctioned off to the highest bidder. Should the public have legal rights to use some channels, if they can get up enough money to run a TV station or radio stations? Seems odd and contradictory that you have buy rights, especially public rights. It sounds similar to the media situation in Venezuela when foreign investors and those in power owned the media there and sold their oil to line the pockets of a few, while people where still eating out of the dumps and with an 80% poverty level and had little concept of what was going on.

Among many other things, Meng helped build Google's first mobile search service, and headed the team that kept a vigilant eye on Google's search quality. After an eight-year stint in Engineering, he now serves with GoogleEDU as the Head of Personal Growth. One of his main projects is Search Inside Yourself -- a mindfulness-based emotional intelligence course, which he hopes will eventually contribute to world peace in a meaningful way.

Outside of Google, Meng is the Founder and (Jolly Good) President of the Tan Teo Charitable Foundation, a small foundation dedicated to promoting peace, liberty and enlightenment in the world. He is a founding patron of Stanford University's Center for Compassion and Altruism Research and Education (CCARE).  He is also a founding patron of the World Peace Festival, and adviser to a number of technology startups.Nokia researcher Jan Chipchase shares some unexpected discoveries about the way people around the world interact with cell phones -- even so far as the emotional bonds we seem to share with them. An emotional talk by John Doerr, Silicon Valley's legendary moneyman, makes the case for investing in green technology -- to save the planet and make a profit to boot. Sasa Vucinic, meanwhile, wants to spread his plan to foster new free presses -- by treating them as entrepreneurs instead of charity cases.
Richard St. John was on his way to the TED conference when a girl on the plane asked him, "What really leads to success?" Even though he had achieved some success, he couldn't explain how he did it. So he spent the next ten years researching success and asking over 500 extraordinarily successful people in many fields what helped them succeed. After analyzing, sorting, and correlating millions of words of research, and building one of the most organized databases on the subject of success, he discovered The 8 Traits Successful People Have in Common and wrote the bestseller 8 To Be Great. 

In his books and talks, he shares a wealth of wisdom from the world's most successful people -- knowledge that can help others succeed in their own way, whether it's escaping poverty, building a business, raising a family, or changing the world.
Raised in apartheid South Africa, Auret van Heerden became an activist early. As a student, he agitated for workers' rights and co-wrote a book on trade unionism; he was tortured and placed in solitary confinement, then exiled in 1987. (Later, in post-apartheid South Africa, he became labor attaché to the South African mission to the UN.) For the past decade he's been the president and CEO of the Fair Labor Association, or FLA, an initiative that brings together companies, NGOs and universities to develop and keep up international labor standards in global supply chains. 

Founded in 1999, the FLA grew out of a task force convened by President Clinton to investigate and end child labor and other sweatshop practices. Difficult enough in the US, protecting labor is even more complex in the global economy, with its multiple sets of laws and layers of contractors and outsourcers. Policing the entire chain is impossible, so the FLA works instead to help all parties agree that protecting workers is the best way to do business, and agree on voluntary initiatives to get there. The FLA worked with Apple Computer, for example, to inspect its global factories and seek raises and better working conditions at the Foxconn plant in China. 

Van Heerden and FLA create a safe space in which stakeholders representing different interest groups within a global supply chain can work together to resolve conflicts of rights and interests, filling in the governance gap. Van Heerden's newest initiative: the Institute for Social and Environmental Responsibility, which will conduct research and convene multi-stakeholder forums on corporate responsibility.

"The gold standard, I think, is the Fair Labor Association. It leads the way ... because its Secretariat is encouraged and even mandated to cast a critical eye on performance and to recommend practical innovations."
Don Tapscott takes a farseeing look at our digital, connected, hypercollaborative world. He's the chair of Moxie Insight and has written 14 books about aspects of this new world, helping readers understand where the world is heading as our civilization fundamentally reshapes itself. In 1995, his book The Digital Economy was among the first to show how the internet would change the way we did business; in 2000, he defined the Net Generation and the “digital divide” in Growing Up Digital.

In his most recent works, he thinks deeply about newly possible collaboration "on an astronomical scale." As the Industrial Age comes to an end, all our institutions are challenged (state, corporations, schools), he argues--and suggests that we need to reboot and reinvent civilization.

"The Macrowikinomics assertion that 'there has never been a more exciting time to be human' is spot on."
